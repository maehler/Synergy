    the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations,
    substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater
    than the sum of their separate effects.

    This is a set of tools for exploring the gene regulation in the
    cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i>. To get started, go to the
    <a href="search">Gene search</a> tool and find your favorite gene,
    or maybe upload a list of differentially expressed genes. From there
    you can explore the co-expression network of those genes, perform
    Gene Ontology (GO) and motif enrichment and get more detailed
    information about the genes and motifs found.

    Below you can find a video describing case study 2 from our paper
    (<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0113496">Mähler
    <i>et al.</i> (2014). <i>Syne</i>rgy: A web resource for exploring
    gene regulation in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC6803. PLOS ONE 9(11):e113496</a>). It
    describes how you can perform an integrated analysis of both regulatory
    motifs and co-expression.
