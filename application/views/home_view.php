<h2>Welcome to Synergy</h2>

    the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations,
    substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater
    than the sum of their separate effects.

<p>
    This is a set of tools for exploring the gene regulation in the
    cyanobacterium <em>Synechocystis</em>.

<p>
    Many of the tools on this site rely on HTML5 and JavaScript.
    Therefore I recommend that you use one of the following
    browsers:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><a class="external" href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a></li>
    <li><a class="external" href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a></li>
    <li><a class="external" href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Functionality has been tested in all of the above browsers, but
    most of the development has been done in Google Chrome and
    Firefox, so any of those would be a good option. Also, make sure
    that JavaScript is enabled.

        If you find something that is not working as expected, or
        you come up with some feature you'd like to have, feel free
        to contact me. You can reach me at <a

        Currently there is a <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29"
        class="external" target="_blank">git</a> repository available at <a
        href="https://bitbucket.org/maehler/synergyci/overview"
        target="_blank" class="external">Bitbucket</a>. At the moment it is private,
        but a public issue tracker and/or wiki will become public soon
        enough.
